You are a seasoned top-level engineer that specializes in DevsOps.

Design a practical, “agentic DevOps” system to stand up and iterate. Below is a concise blueprint, feel free to adapt, change, add. Use any tools and sub-agents needed for this.

Agentic DevOps: Blueprint + Starter Pack

1 What the agent should do (scope)
 • CI/CD orchestration: test → build → scan → deploy (staging/canary/prod) → verify → rollback.
 • Infra as Code: plan/apply changes safely (dry-run, policy checks).
 • Ops guardrails: change windows, approvals, blast-radius limits, budget & SLO gates.
 • Incident response: detect alerts, pick the right runbook, execute steps, summarize postmortems.
 • Docs & comms: PR comments, changelogs, release notes, Slack/Teams updates.

3 The agent team (roles)
 • Conductor (Planner/Policy): converts events into plans; enforces guardrails; requests approvals.
 • CI Agent: runs tests/builds/scans; writes artifacts & SBOM; comments on PRs.
 • Release Agent: deploys to envs, runs smoke checks/canaries, promotes or rolls back.
 • Infra Agent: terraform/helm plan→policy→apply with drift detection.
 • SRE Agent: triages alerts, selects runbooks, executes remediations, writes postmortems.
 • SecOps Agent (optional): SAST/DAST/secret scan; blocks on critical findings.
 • Doc Agent (optional): release notes, changelogs, architecture diffs.

Each “agent” is basically a prompt + toolset + small state machine.

⸻

4 Guardrails you’ll want (non-negotiable)
 • Change windows (e.g., no prod deploy Fri 18:00–Mon 08:00 unless override).
 • Approval thresholds (e.g., medium-risk = 1 approver; high-risk = 2 approvers).
 • SLO / health gates (error rate, latency, saturation) before/after deploy.
 • Security & compliance (no secrets in logs/PRs; CVSS ≥ 7 blocks release).
 • Blast radius (max % traffic in canary; auto-rollback if SLO breached).
 • Budget guardrail (reject infra plan if it increases cost > X% MoM).

⸻

5 Event model (what wakes the system)
 • VCS: PR opened, PR updated, tag pushed, commit to main.
 • CI: pipeline finished, test failure, coverage/SBOM available.
 • Ops: alert firing/resolved, error budget burn, cost anomaly.
 • Manual: “/deploy staging”, “/rollback”, “/run runbook ”.

6 Tooling interface (function tools the LLM may call)

7 Agent prompts (succinct examples)

Conductor (system prompt excerpt)

You are the DevOps Conductor. Convert events into a safe plan, then call tools to execute it.
Enforce guardrails: change windows, approval thresholds, SLO gates, security policy, cost limits.
Never leak secrets. Summarize outcomes to humans with clear, actionable next steps.
Prefer staged rollouts and automatic rollbacks on SLO breach. Keep logs concise.

Release Agent (system prompt excerpt)

Given a build artifact and environment, produce a rollout plan: staging → canary (≤10%) → full.
After each step: run smoke tests and metrics_check. If thresholds fail, call k8s_rollback and notify.

SRE Agent (incident runbook selector)

When an alert arrives, classify severity, pick a runbook by symptom, execute steps, then file a brief postmortem: timeline, root cause hypothesis, remediation, follow-ups.

⸻

8 Runbook format (markdown + frontmatter)

---
id: runbook-500s-spike
title: 500s Spike > X/min
severity: high
match:
  metric: http_5xx_rate
  threshold: ">= 1% for 5m"
steps:

- "metrics_check(service: {{service}}, window_min: 5)"
- "kubectl rollout status deploy/{{service}} -n {{env}}"
- "if recent deploy < 30m → k8s_rollback(environment: {{env}}, service: {{service}})"
- "notify(channel: '#ops', severity: 'critical', message: 'Rolled back {{service}} {{env}} due to 5xx spike')"
postmortem_template: |

# Postmortem: {{service}} {{env}}

  Timeline:
  Impact:
  Suspected Cause:
  Remediation:
  Follow-ups:

Store runbooks in a repo folder (e.g., runbooks/) for versioning.

9 Minimal orchestrator skeleton (TypeScript, pseudo-implementation)

// orchestrator.ts
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import { callLLM, toolRouter, policy } from "./runtime"; // your wrappers

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post("/event", async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body; // PR, tag push, alert, slash-command, etc.
  // 1) Pre-check policy (e.g., change window)
  const pre = policy.precheck(event);
  if (!pre.allowed) return res.status(200).send({ action: "blocked", reason: pre.reason });

  // 2) Call Conductor to produce a plan + tool calls (function-calling)
  const plan = await callLLM("conductor", {
    event,
    context: await loadContext(event),  // recent builds, SLOs, approvals
    guardrails: policy.export()
  }, toolRouter);

  // 3) Execute any pending tool calls that Conductor requested (toolRouter handles it)
  // toolRouter should: execute safely, redact secrets, persist artifacts/logs
  res.status(200).send({ status: "ok", planSummary: plan.summary });
});

app.listen(8080, () => console.log("Orchestrator listening on :8080"));

toolRouter maps the JSON tools (above) to your real backends (GitHub, K8s, Terraform, Vault, Slack, Datadog, etc.). Persist every step (start/end, inputs/outputs, hashes) to Postgres; push bulky logs to object storage.

            )

11 Default deployment plan (Release Agent policy)

 1. Staging: deploy, smoke tests, metrics_check(window=10m).
 2. Canary: route 5–10% traffic, metrics_check(window=10–30m).
 3. Full: promote to 100% if green; otherwise auto-rollback and notify.
 4. Post-deploy: comment PR with links to dashboards/logs & a short summary.

⸻

12 Data & memory
 • Postgres: runs (id, event, plan, approvals, status), artifacts index, decisions.
 • Redis/Queue: tool call jobs; rate-limit to avoid API abuse.
 • Object storage: CI logs, SBOM, plan diffs, deployment reports.
 • Config: policy.yaml (guardrails), runbooks/, service registry.

15 Example “/deploy” slash-command (chat UX)
 • /deploy svc=checkout env=staging image=registry/app:1.8.2
 • Conductor: validates policy → asks Release Agent for a plan → executes → posts status thread with links.

⸻

16 Testing strategy (before real prod)
 • Replay mode: feed historical PRs/alerts; ensure plans obey policy.
 • Dry-run tools: k8s --dry-run=server, terraform plan only, fake metrics.
 • Game days: inject failures (build fail, SLO breach) and confirm rollback + comms.

⸻

17 One-week MVP plan (realistic)
 • Day 1–2: event gateway + Conductor prompt + two core tools (notify, git_comment_pr) + policy.yaml.
 • Day 3: CI Agent (test/build/scan) + PR comments + artifacts.
 • Day 4: Release Agent with k8s_deploy + canary + metrics_check (fake backend first).
 • Day 5: SRE Agent + 2 runbooks + rollback flow.
 • Day 6: Approval workflow + change windows + redaction.
 • Day 7: Docs, dashboards, and replay tests.

⸻

18 What you’ll need to wire for “real”
 • Secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler) behind secrets_get.
 • Metrics (Prometheus/Datadog/New Relic) behind metrics_check.
 • K8s access (service account/RBAC + cluster per env).
 • Image registry (GHCR/ECR/GCR) plus SBOM signing if desired (Cosign).
 • Ticketing (Jira/Linear) for auto-created incidents and follow-ups.

⸻

 • CI: GitHub Actions (hosted runners + OIDC to GCP). Add self-hosted runners on GKE later if you need GPU/heavy builds.
 • CD: Google Cloud Deploy (managed, simple) → GKE. Optionally Argo Rollouts for canaries.
 • Cluster: GKE Autopilot (regional, private) for dev/staging/prod (start single cluster w/ namespaces; move to per-env later).
 • Registry: Artifact Registry (regional).
 • Auth: Workload Identity (in-cluster) + Workload Identity Federation (OIDC) between GitHub and GCP.
 • Observability: Cloud Logging/Monitoring + Managed Prometheus; keep OpenTelemetry ready.
 • Security: Binary Authorization, GCP Secret Manager, Policies via Policy Controller (OPA/Gatekeeper).

Turn this into a ready-to-paste repo scaffold (TypeScript runtime + policy + runbooks + GitHub Actions) and map each tool to concrete APIs.

Baseline Architecture

GitHub (PR / main)
   │ OIDC (no long-lived creds)
   ▼
GitHub Actions  ── build/test/scan → Artifact Registry (images/SBOM)
   │
   └─> Cloud Deploy (release pipeline)
           │
           └─> GKE Autopilot (regional, private)
                  ├─ Namespaces: dev / staging / prod
                  ├─ Gateway API / Ingress (L7)
                  ├─ Argo Rollouts (optional canary)
                  └─ Workload Identity, Secret Manager, Binary Auth

Networking & Ingress
 • Use Gateway API (L7) with the GKE Gateway controller or standard GCLB Ingress.
 • TLS: Google-managed certs or cert-manager.
 • Private cluster + Cloud NAT for egress; restrict public IPs.

 Observability
 • Enable Managed Prometheus (GMP), scrape app metrics; ship logs to Cloud Logging.
 • Add SLOs in Cloud Monitoring (latency/error rate) and wire your agentic gates to query them.

⸻

Security Hardening (quick wins)
 • Binary Authorization to allow only signed images (Cosign) and/or from your Artifact Registry.
 • Workload Identity for pods (no kube-mounted JSON keys).
 • Secret Manager + CSI driver; never bake secrets into images.
 • Policy Controller (Gatekeeper): block :latest, require resource limits, enforce network policies.

⸻

Self-hosted runners (optional, when you outgrow hosted)
 • Deploy actions-runner-controller to GKE in a ci namespace.
 • Benefits: cache big deps, mount GPUs, build large monorepos.
 • Keep OIDC for deploy permissions; runners don’t need long-lived keys.

⸻

Progressive delivery (optional)
 • Install Argo Rollouts and use Canary with metric analysis (Prometheus). Cloud Deploy + Rollouts also works.

⸻

Cost & Scale Hints
 • Autopilot bills per-pod; great for spiky/low steady load. If constant high load, consider Standard with tailored node pools (spot for dev).
 • Turn on image caching and buildx cache in CI to cut minutes and cost.
 • Use regional resources (GKE/Artifact Registry) for HA.
